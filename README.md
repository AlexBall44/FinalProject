# FinalProject
Melting Point Analysis:
This Python script reads in a Microsoft Excel file containing temperature and absorbance data and produces a plot of the absorbance vs. temperature as well as the derivative of absorbance with respect to temperature.

Dependencies:
This script requires the following Python packages to be installed.
pandas,
matplotlib,
numpy, and
scipy

Input and Output:
The input file for this script is an Excel file named CDmelt.xlsx located in the same directory as the script.

The script produces two output plots:

A plot of the original data with temperature on the x-axis and absorbance on the y-axis.
A plot of the derivative of the absorbance with respect to temperature, with temperature on the x-axis and the derivative on the y-axis.

Example:
An example input file test_data.xlsx is provided in the same directory as the script.
